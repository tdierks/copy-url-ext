copy-url-ext
------------

A Chrome extension which copies the URL for the current tab as a formatted link, so
you can paste it into a target that takes HTML off the clipboard and get the page
title and the link in a single paste.

Available on the Chrome Web Store at
[Copy link](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/copy-link/cgkebkmimknmkflnkcdagamcifjnbfne)

It can put distinct contents onto the "text" version of the clipboard (used when you
paste into a text-only field, like a text editor or an email subject line) and the
"html" version of the clipbord (used when you paste into a formatted field like an
email body or a document). By default, the text version gets a bare URL, but it can be
configured to give you a [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax#link)
formatted link instead.

Similarly, you can configure the anchor text on the formatted link to be either the page
title alone or the title and URL together.
