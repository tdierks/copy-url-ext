copy-url-ext
------------

A Chrome extension which copies the URL for the current tab as a formatted link, so
you can paste it into a target that takes HTML off the clipboard and get the page
title and the link in a single paste. It copies the URL alone into the plain text part
of the clipboard, so pasting into a plain-text destination will receive just the URL.
